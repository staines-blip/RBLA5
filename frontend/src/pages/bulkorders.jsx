            Shipping costs are based on the final weight of the products. We will give you the final price prior to shipping. All our shipments are sent via internationally reputed logistics partners who handle customs clearances. 
            However, the customer will have to bear any additional customs duties or taxes that may arise.

            <h2>HANDCRAFTED VARIATIONS</h2>
            <p>
            All of our products are handcrafted. Bulk orders for these products are necessarily subject to a unique set of conditions, given the fact that each product will be made individually. 
            In spite of these variables, UnityThreads stands behind the quality of our products.
